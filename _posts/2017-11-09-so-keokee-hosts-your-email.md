Have you found yourself needing to set up your email again, but can't find the information?  Or, are you new to your office? Whatever the reason, follow the steps below to get up and running with your Keokee provided email in a jiffy.

While you're getting your mail client set up, try web mail via your favorite web browser. Use the following URL structure with your domain.

webmail.example.com

The ***username*** and ***password*** are your email address and before chosen password.

## Step 1: Find your hosting server 
If you don't know already, find out which of our hosting servers you are on. You can do this by giving us a call at 208-263-3573. Let the receptionist know you have a hosting question.

Your hosting server will be one of these:
- lake.keokee.com
- tree.keokee.com
- moose.keokee.com

## Step 2: Determine whether to use IMAP or POP3

**POP3**
- You can use only one computer to check your email.
- Your email is stored on the computer.

POP3 is a better choice when you need to save a lot of emails, but have a small amount of server storage available.

**IMAP**
- You can use more than one device to check your email.
- Your email is stored on the server/cloud.

IMAP is a better choice when you want to use more than one device. Be prepared to keep your inbox super clean, or have lots of server/cloud storage available.

## Step 3: Configure your mail client. 

A few mail client examples are:

- Outlook
- Apple Mail
- Thunderbird

Each mail client requires different steps to setup, but uses the same configuration.

[Setup instructions for any mail client](https://www.liquidweb.com/kb/how-to-set-up-any-e-mail-client){:target="\_blank"}

Here's the configuration we recommend (make sure to replace **Host** with your host found in **Step 1**):

### IMAP
**Host:** tree.keokee.com  
**Encryption Type:** SSL  
**Port:** 993  

### POP
**Host:** tree.keokee.com  
**Encryption Type:** SSL  
**Port:** 995  

### SMTP
**Host:** tree.keokee.com  
**Encryption Type:** SSL  
**Port:** 465  

**Username:** example@yourdomain.com  
**Password:** yourpassword12345!

## Step 4: Enjoy your email!
