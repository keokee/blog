Google users and the local businesses in the US are already noticing the **new Carousel design** for the Google local search results. The Carousel makes online browsing a more visual experience, it works especially well with the local results for restaurants, hotels, and points of interest. A typical search to see this new design would be something like “Sandpoint Idaho restaurants” as you can see on the image above. Google will put the Carousel feature at the top of the page, including a logo or photo, pricing and cuisine. A click on these restaurants will bring up their Local Places listings and search results with more information, like on the following example below:

This new **local search Carousel** is just a part of Google's big Maps update: Google Maps will engage and interact with the users to customize the map search through user's ratings, reviews, and comments for the local places and businesses. On the official preview page Google describes how we all help Maps and local search get better:

> As you search the map, star places you like and leave reviews, the map starts to adapt and can suggest things like restaurants you might enjoy or the quickest way home. In other words, the more you use the new Google Maps, the more helpful it becomes.
