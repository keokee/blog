We like our human visitors, but they generally can't match the cuteness factor of this **baby great horned owl** that came by our office yesterday. One of our editors, Billie Jean, came across this little fellow after it fell or was kicked out of its nest. Too young to fly, it would have almost certainly perished, so our heroine Billie Jean gathered it for <a title="Birds of Prey Northwest" href="http://birdsofpreynorthwest.org/" target="_blank">Birds of Prey Northwest</a>, and handler Blake Schiöberg swung by to pick it up. BOP Northwest does amazing work in raptor rescue, and director Jane Fink consults with us on our <a title="Sandpoint osprey web cam" href="http://ospreys.sandpointonline.com" target="_blank">osprey webcam</a>.
