Keokee hit its silver anniversary in May, marking **the 25th year since the company began** on a shoestring in May 1990. Way back then a reporter at the local Daily Bee named David Gunter wrote a "new business" story about our startup. Twenty-five years later, lo, the same David Gunter wrote up a story for the May 31, 2015 Daily Bee on Keokee's first quarter century. It's a profile of our company founder and bit of a history about how Keokee got started. **You can blame it on the earthquake.**
