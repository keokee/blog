The new summer issue of **Sandpoint Magazine** hit the streets on Friday, May 16, and (*if we don't say so ourselves*) it is packed with excellent stories, photos and art about Sandpoint and our neck of these North Idaho woods. The magazine is distributed at more than 200 locations around the region; big distribution points in Sandpoint are at Yokes, Safeway and Super 1 Foods; the Greater Sandpoint Chamber; and downtown at the Cedar Street Bridge; and a passel of retail shops.
