Many businesses in our hometown of Sandpoint - as in other vacation destinations - depend on travelers. **This week brought some exciting news particularly for lodging, restaurant and retail businesses that cater to tourists**: Pinterest introduced **<a href="http://blog.pinterest.com/post/67622502341/introducing-place-pins-for-the-explorer-in-all-of-us" target="_blank">Place Pins</a>** to make its website more useful for travel.

Now users can create **better pinboards for trip planning and highlight hotspots in their particular neighborhood**, which they can also share on other social networks or via email! Pinterest users can access these map boards from anywhere on their smartphone or tablet, too, which means they can find new places on the go and even get directions. Pin locations include information about retailers and restaurants, their addresses and phone numbers.

Pinterest offers a simple pop-up guide when you log into your account to help you create a board of Place Pins. Just select Add a map when you create a new board or Edit an old board to Add a map. Then you click Map this Pin and search for the name or the location.

For example, if we pin a photo of a burger from a local restaurant in Sandpoint, we can also add the restaurant's location to a map on our board. Place Pins for travelers, Recipe Pins that include ingredients and directions alongside a food photo, Product Pins that offer details like price and availability of the pinned item, and Article Pins for users sharing news stories on their pinboards, - all of these recent Pinterest innovations offer amazing marketing opportunities for the businesses! For free.
